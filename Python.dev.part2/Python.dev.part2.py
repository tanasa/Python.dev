üîπ Python Arrays ‚Äì Key Features

üì¶ 1. Types of Arrays in Python

Built-in array module ‚Üí Basic, type-restricted arrays (less common)
NumPy arrays (numpy.ndarray) ‚Üí Powerful, fast, and flexible (widely used in data science)

üîπ 2. array.array (from standard library)

from array import array
a = array('i', [1, 2, 3])  # 'i' = typecode for integers

Fixed-type arrays (all elements must be the same type)

Typecodes define data type: 'i' (int), 'f' (float), 'd' (double), etc.

Key methods:

append(x) ‚Üí Add to end
insert(i, x) ‚Üí Insert at index
pop(i) ‚Üí Remove at index
remove(x) ‚Üí Remove by value
a[i] ‚Üí Indexing
a[i:j] ‚Üí Slicing

üîπ 3. numpy.ndarray (from NumPy library)

import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

Supports multi-dimensional arrays, broadcasting, and vectorized operations.

Much faster and more powerful than lists or array.array for numerical work.

Key features:

Fixed data type (e.g., int32, float64)
Fast math: a + 10, a * 2, a ** 2
Slicing & indexing: a[1:3], a[:, 0]
Broadcasting: automatic alignment of shapes in operations
Matrix operations: dot products, transposes, inverses
Shape manipulation: reshape(), flatten(), transpose()

Common methods:

np.append()
np.concatenate()
np.insert()
np.delete()
np.mean()
np.sum()
np.std()
np.argmax(), etc.

üîÅ 4. Iteration
for x in a: ...
Works for both array.array and NumPy arrays

With NumPy: also supports vectorized operations ‚Üí no loop needed!

What is Vectorization (or "Vectorized Operations")?

Vectorized operations refer to performing operations on entire arrays or collections of data at once, 
rather than looping through elements one by one.

This is a core concept in NumPy, and it makes your code faster and more concise.

üÜö Traditional vs Vectorized

üö´ Without vectorization (loop-based):

result = []
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    result.append(x * 2)  # Multiply each number by 2

‚úÖ With vectorization (NumPy):

import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
result = a * 2  # Applies *2 to the whole array at once

Same result: [2, 4, 6], but much faster and cleaner with NumPy.

‚öôÔ∏è Why Vectorization is Powerful

Internally, NumPy uses optimized C code for operations, avoiding slow Python loops.

It takes advantage of CPU-level parallelism (e.g., SIMD ‚Äì single instruction, multiple data).

It lets you write code that‚Äôs shorter, cleaner, and often closer to math notation.

üìå Examples of Vectorized Operations

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

a + b          # [5, 7, 9]
a * b          # [4, 10, 18]
a ** 2         # [1, 4, 9]
np.sqrt(a)     # [1.0, 1.41, 1.73]

Vectorization over Matrices

matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix * 10
# [[10, 20],
#  [30, 40]]

Python Lists ‚Äì Key Features

Mutable

You can change, add, or remove elements after creation.

Operators

+ ‚Üí Concatenate two lists: [1, 2] + [3, 4] ‚Üí [1, 2, 3, 4]
* ‚Üí Repeat a list: [1, 2] * 3 ‚Üí [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]

Slicing

Get sublist: a[1:4]
Insert: a[n:n] = [...]
Delete: a[m:n] = []
Replace: a[m:n] = [...]

List Methods

append(x) ‚Üí Add to end
insert(i, x) ‚Üí Insert at index
pop(i) ‚Üí Remove by index (default last)
remove(x) ‚Üí Remove first matching value
extend(iterable) ‚Üí Add elements from another list
del a[m:n] ‚Üí Delete a slice

Looping

for item in list: ‚Üí Loop through elements
for i, val in enumerate(list): ‚Üí Loop with index

Other Tips

Lists can hold mixed types (e.g., [1, "two", 3.0])
Can be nested (e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]])

Use list comprehensions for compact code:

What is a Lambda Function?

A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function (i.e., it has no name) used for short, simple operations.

It‚Äôs a quick way to define a function inline without using def.

You can have any number of arguments but only one expression.
The result of the expression is automatically returned.

‚ö†Ô∏è When to Use Lambda Functions : the function is short and simple

You don't need to reuse the function elsewhere
You're passing a function as an argument (like in map(), filter(), sorted())

add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8

# 2. Square a number:

square = lambda x: x ** 2

# 3. Use with map():

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, nums))
# Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]

# 4. Use with filter():

even = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))
# Output: [2, 4]

# 5. Use with sorted() (custom sorting):

words = ['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi']

Why is it called "lambda"?

The name "lambda" comes from lambda calculus, a formal system in mathematical logic developed in the 1930s by Alonzo Church.

üßÆ Lambda calculus:

It‚Äôs a foundational concept in computer science.
It models computation using anonymous functions.

The Greek letter Œª (lambda) was used to define functions.
For example, Œªx.x + 1 is like saying "a function that takes x and returns x + 1".

Python borrowed this terminology when it introduced anonymous functions, and used the keyword lambda to mimic that idea.

# üÜö map() vs List Comprehension

# Using map
list(map(str.upper, ['hello', 'world']))

# Equivalent using list comprehension

# ‚úÖ Use map() when you already have a function to apply
# ‚úÖ Use list comprehensions when you want flexibility and readability

# üö® Things to remember:
# map() is lazy ‚Äì it only evaluates when iterated over (e.g., in a for loop or when converted to a list).
