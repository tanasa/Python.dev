üß† What is property() in Python?

property() is a built-in Python function.

It allows you to turn a method into an attribute.

This lets you control access to private data ‚Äî while keeping the syntax clean and simple (like accessing .name instead of calling .get_name()).

üì¶ Basic Structure of property()

property(fget=None, fset=None, fdel=None, doc=None)

''')

print('''

Why is it called fget?

When you use the property() function in Python, it can take up to four functions:

Argument name	Purpose
fget	Function to get the attribute (getter)
fset	Function to set the attribute (setter)
fdel	Function to delete the attribute (deleter)
doc	Docstring (documentation string) for the property

''')


# In[29]:


print(''' 

1. Without using property()
You have to call methods explicitly to get, set, or delete the name.

    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    def get_name(self):

        self._name = value

print(p.get_name())    # ‚ûî Alice

p.set_name("Bob")
print(p.get_name())    # ‚ûî Bob

p.del_name()

# ‚úÖ Works fine, but you always need to call methods like get_name() and set_name() ‚Äî it's verbose and less elegant

print('''

2. With property()
Now you can pretend that _name is a normal attribute, but still control access internally.

    name = property(fget=get_name, fset=set_name, fdel=del_name, doc="The person's name.")

print('''

Summary of the Difference:

Without property()	With property()
You must call .get_name(), .set_name() manually	You just use .name naturally
Less Pythonic, more like Java style	More Pythonic, cleaner syntax
Methods are obviously exposed	Methods hidden behind attribute access
Good for very strict control	Good for most real-world usage

''')

print('''

Now, why does property() offer protection?

Because it gives you full control over how the attribute is accessed, changed, or deleted ‚Äî 
even though the user thinks they are just accessing a normal attribute.

In other words:

The user believes they are working with a simple variable: p.name

But you decide exactly what happens when they read (get), write (set), or delete (del) it.

You can add checks, validations, transformations, logging, etc., inside your get_name, set_name, or del_name.

üéØ In contrast
Without property(), the user can freely modify internal attributes (p._name) directly without any control.

With property(), even though the syntax is clean, you hide the real implementation and intercept every action.
