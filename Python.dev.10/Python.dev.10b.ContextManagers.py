üß† What is a Context Manager?

A context manager is an object that defines actions to be performed when entering and exiting a block of code ‚Äî 
typically used with the with statement.

‚úÖ The classic example:

with open('file.txt') as f:
    data = f.read()

What happens:

open('file.txt') returns a context manager object (a file handler).

__enter__() is called ‚Üí opens the file.

You do stuff inside the with block.

__exit__() is called ‚Üí closes the file, even if an error occurs!

‚úÖ Ensures cleanup is always performed (like closing files, releasing locks, or rolling back transactions).

üß± Key Methods of a Context Manager
To create a context manager manually, you define a class with:

class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        # setup (e.g., open file, start timer)
        return resource

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        # cleanup (e.g., close file, stop timer)
        return False  # or True to suppress exceptions

# Simple Timer Context Manager (measure execution time)

import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.time()
        return self

# When the with Timer(): block starts, Python calls __enter__().

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        self.end = time.time()
        print('Elapsed time:', self.end - self.start)

# ‚úÖ What happens here:
# When the with block ends (whether normally or with an exception), Python calls __exit__().
# self.end = time.time() captures the current time at the end.
# self.end - self.start calculates the time difference (how long the block took).
    
# Usage
with Timer():
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate some work

# What happens step-by-step:
# Timer().__enter__() is called:
# Starts timing
# Executes time.sleep(2):
# Waits for 2 seconds
# Timer().__exit__() is called:
# Stops timing
# Calculates elapsed time



# In[8]:


# Explanations : 
# Timer.__enter__()
#    ‚Üí records start time
#    ‚Üì
# Run the code inside the `with` block
#    ‚Üì
# Timer.__exit__()
#    ‚Üí records end time, prints elapsed time

Example: Acquiring and Releasing a Lock

Suppose you are working in a multi-threaded Python program,
and you need to lock a shared resource so that only one thread accesses it at a time.

‚úÖ You want to:

Acquire a lock before doing something critical

Release it afterward no matter what (even if there‚Äôs an error)

‚úÖ This is a perfect job for a context manager.

''')


# In[11]:


print('''

Big takeaway:

Context managers are perfect for managing critical resources
(locks, database connections, file handles, network sockets, etc.)

Threading lock

Database transaction (BEGIN ‚Üí COMMIT/ROLLBACK)

Open network connection (connect ‚Üí close)

‚úÖ All of these real-world systems use the same context manager pattern.
